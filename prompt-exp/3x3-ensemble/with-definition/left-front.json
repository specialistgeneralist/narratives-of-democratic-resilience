This creates a stark moral division that is characteristic of populist rhetoric.\n\n2. **Indivisible people**: The text refers to \"the people\" as a homogeneous entity that should \"exercise power for real\" through a Sixth Republic, treating citizens as a unified bloc with common interests.\n\n3. **General will**: The text explicitly mentions the \"general interest\" in opposition to the \"insatiable greed of a few,\" suggesting there is one unified interest of the people regarding social security and environmental protection.\n\n4. **People-centrism**: The statement that \"the people must exercise power for real\" directly advocates for sovereignty lying exclusively with ordinary citizens rather than current leaders.\n\n5. **Anti-elitism**: The text strongly opposes the \"financial oligarchy\" and criticizes leaders who are dependent on them, displaying clear anti-elite sentiments.\n\nThe language employs revolutionary rhetoric (\"citizen revolution\") and frames the situation as an urgent moral imperative where \"the people\" must take back power from financial elites. The text fulfills all five dimensions of the populist framework with direct and unambiguous language, making it a clear example of populist narrative.",
