Appeals to the \"common sense\" of ordinary people\n\nLet me analyze the provided text:\n\n\"We do not want to be part of the establishment.\" - This is clearly anti-establishment rhetoric.\n\n\"The VB is no protest party but a principled programme party.\" - This suggests they're not just opposing for opposition's sake, but have a legitimate program, distancing themselves from being labeled merely as protesters.\n\n\"A maverick in Flemish politics.\" - Positioning themselves as outsiders to the mainstream political system.\n\n\"We are not welcome in the Belgian salons precisely because we want to abolish these salons.\" - This is anti-elite rhetoric, with \"Belgian salons\" likely metaphorically representing elite political gatherings or establishments. They are positioning themselves as excluded by the elite because they threaten the elite's existence.\n\nThe term \"VB\" likely refers to Vlaams Belang, a right-wing Flemish nationalist and populist political party in Belgium.\n\nThis text contains several classic elements of populist rhetoric:\n- Strong anti-establishment sentiment\n- Positioning themselves as outsiders to the system\n- Portraying themselves as a threat to the elite (and proud of it)\n- Suggesting they're excluded because they challenge the status quo\n\nGiven these elements, I would categorize this text as exhibiting a strong populist narrative.",
