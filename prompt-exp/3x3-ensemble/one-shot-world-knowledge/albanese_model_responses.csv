Claude 3.7 Sonnet (LLM),weak yes,"** - Appeals to ""the people"" vs. untrustworthy government elites.

The text shows some populist elements by positioning itself against an establishment portrayed as corrupt and disconnected from ordinary citizens. It creates a division between ""Australians"" (the people) and the current government that allegedly misuses public funds and avoids responsibility. The promise to ""restore trust"" implies the current system is broken and needs fixing, which aligns with populist rhetoric. However, it lacks stronger populist markers like explicit anti-elite language or claims about a ""pure people"" being victimized, hence the ""weak yes"" rating."
