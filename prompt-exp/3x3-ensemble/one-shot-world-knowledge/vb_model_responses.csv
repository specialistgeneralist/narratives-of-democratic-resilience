**Justification**: Anti-establishment rhetoric dividing ""us"" versus elite ""salons""

The text contains clear populist elements including:
1. Explicit anti-establishment positioning (""We do not want to be part of the establishment"")
2. Portrayal of an ""us versus them"" dynamic between the VB party and the ""Belgian salons""
3. Self-identification as a ""maverick"" outsider in politics
4. Claim of being excluded by elites (""not welcome in the Belgian salons"")
5. Stated desire to dismantle existing power structures (""abolish these salons"")

These are hallmark characteristics of populist rhetoric, which typically frames politics as a struggle between ordinary people and corrupt elites or establishments."
